###Change to Documented API
Good morning team. As you know we've been planning to implement our vehicle inventory system as an Object Oriented system with many different types of vehicles all inheriting from our base `Vehicle` class. All we know right now, is that we are going to have things like a `Car` class, a `Truck` class, and a `Minivan` class. 

However, we just got word that our front end developers don't really understand OOP and the concept of `new()` and object instantiation. They are primarily used to consuming API's and just requesting something and getting an object back.

###Your Task
We will be carrying forward with our original plan of building our OOP architecture, but we need you to come up with a method to accept a string as input which will be the type of vehicle we want __("car", "truck", "minivan")__ but still return an instantiated instance of the type of object we have created as our OOP implementation.

I have no idea how this will work so we need you to mock up the OOP inheritance and classes and implement a simple example of the function that will take the input as described and return that type of vehicle.

Thaaaaankks :D
